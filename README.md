# 3-tier-architecture

## About This Project
To continue learning and building on my IaC skills, I designed & created an AWS CloudFormation template that deploys a 3-tier architecture consisting of a web, application, and database tier.

### Use-Case
Build a scalable and reliable e-commerce platform by deploying a 3-tier architecture infrastructure.

- web tier: will be responsible for serving the static content to end-users and handling incoming requests.
- application tier: will be responsible for processing transactions, handling payments, and interacting with the database.
- database tier: will store all of the platformâ€™s data, including customer information, product data, and transaction records.
